Work Experience
----------

**Backend Software Engineer@Longfor Inc | Beijing , China**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* Software Architecture Group

  * “Hawkeye” Monitoring System: To provide better real-time visibility and traceability of the production system, I developed a “Hawkeye” monitoring 
system which collects API request data via Prometheus and reports to the exporter periodically using UDP, the data then being visualized on Grafana, 
metric data is collected and transferred in a non-blocking asynchronous way using a Single Thread Pool & Blocking Queue to improve performance 
while still preserves the exact order of the metric data been sent;

  * Distributed Universally Unique ID Generator: Implemented Snowflake algorithm to generate Universally Unique ID (UUID) which provides a secure 
and high-performance infrastructure tool for the dev teams to generate UUIDs that satisfy the following properties: 1. Strictly Monotonic increase; 2. 
Randomized ID generation.

* Unified Login Group

  * To provide a unified log-in customer experience for the 40 million Users and over 1 million active Daily Active Users (DAU) under the Longfor 
franchise, we developed a unified member login and management system, empowering tens of products and services across the entire corporation;

  * Innovatively used Redis to store user log-in sessions to eliminate the need for a dedicated Central Authentication Server (CAS) while still managed to 
solve the CORS problem in most Single Sign-on (SSO) system.

* Ads Platform

  * Involved in initial design of a simplified ads platform for internal ads tenants including SSP, Ads Orchestration, Ads Recall, DSP modules, for MVP 
version, Pacing, Ads Exchange and Ranking modules are excluded;

  * Independently implemented Ads Recall and Ads Document Generation module.
  * Advised and involved in cross-department project development, promoted the integration of the ads platform into other systems;


**Backend Software Engineer@WirelessCar | Beijing , China**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* VCC Solution

  * Designed and implemented Emergency Call and Breakdown Call solutions for integration towards Geely TSP and WirelessCar Internal services;


Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Java** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **Python** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
