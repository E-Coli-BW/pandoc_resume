    \quotation{Hawkeye} Monitoring System: To provide better real-time
    visibility and traceability of the production system, I developed a
    \quotation{Hawkeye} monitoring system which collects API request
    data via Prometheus and reports to the exporter periodically using
    UDP, the data then being visualized on Grafana, metric data is
    collected and transferred in a non-blocking asynchronous way using a
    Single Thread Pool & Blocking Queue to improve performance while
    still preserves the exact order of the metric data been sent;
  \item
    Distributed Universally Unique ID Generator: Implemented Snowflake
    algorithm to generate Universally Unique ID (UUID) which provides a
    secure and high-performance infrastructure tool for the dev teams to
    generate UUIDs that satisfy the following properties: 1. Strictly
    Monotonic increase; 2. Randomized ID generation.

  \startitemize
  \item
    To provide a unified log-in customer experience for the 40 million
    Users and over 1 million active Daily Active Users (DAU) under the
    Longfor franchise, we developed a unified member login and
    management system, empowering tens of products and services across
    the entire corporation;
  \item
    Innovatively used Redis to store user log-in sessions to eliminate
    the need for a dedicated Central Authentication Server (CAS) while
    still managed to solve the CORS problem in most Single Sign-on (SSO)
    system.

Experience},reference={technical-experience}]

\startdescription{Programming Languages}
  {\bf Java} Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to add
  descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention some
  others together at the end. A format that works well here is a
  description list where the first few items have their first word
  emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms.
  Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which
  wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

  {\bf Python} Description of your experience with second-lang, perhaps
  again including a {[}link{]}
